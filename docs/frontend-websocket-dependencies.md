## Frontend and Websocket Service Dependencies

### Initial Problem
Frontend and websocket services were not starting due to strict dependencies on the backend service's health status.

### Investigation Process
1. **Service Startup Order**
   - Backend service needed to be healthy before frontend/websocket could start
   - Health checks were failing, preventing dependent services from starting

2. **Health Check Verification**
   - Verified health endpoints in frontend (`/api/health`)
   - Verified health endpoints in websocket service
   - Confirmed both services had proper health check configurations

### Dependencies in Docker Compose
```yaml
frontend:
  depends_on:
    backend:
      condition: service_healthy

websocket:
  depends_on:
    backend:
      condition: service_healthy
```

### Considerations
1. **Pros of Strict Dependencies**
   - Ensures services start in the correct order
   - Prevents errors from unavailable backend services
   - Improves system reliability

2. **Cons of Strict Dependencies**
   - Longer startup time
   - More complex health check configuration
   - All services affected by one service's health status

### Solution Implementation
1. **Health Check Optimization**
   - Reduced health check intervals
   - Added multiple health check endpoints
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **Service Configuration**
   - Maintained strict dependencies for system reliability
   - Optimized startup parameters
   - Added proper logging for debugging

### Results
- Services now start in the correct order
- System maintains reliability while improving startup time
- Clear dependency chain for easier debugging

### Best Practices
1. Use strict dependencies when services genuinely require them
2. Implement proper health checks for dependent services
3. Configure reasonable timeouts and intervals
4. Include comprehensive logging
5. Consider the trade-off between startup time and reliability
