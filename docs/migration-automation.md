## Database Migration Automation

### Initial Problem
Database migrations needed to be run manually after container startup, causing potential issues with service health checks and startup order.

### Investigation Process
1. **Migration Script Analysis**
   - Reviewed existing `migrate.sh` script
   - Checked migration execution in container startup
   - Analyzed error handling and logging

2. **Entrypoint Configuration**
   - Identified missing entrypoint script
   - Reviewed Dockerfile configuration
   - Analyzed service startup sequence

### Solution Implementation
1. **Migration Script Integration**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e

   # Wait for database to be ready
   until flask db current; do
     echo "Database is unavailable - sleeping"
     sleep 1
   done

   echo "Database is up - executing migrations"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

2. **Dockerfile Configuration**
   ```dockerfile
   COPY migrate.sh /usr/local/bin/
   RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/migrate.sh
   
   ENTRYPOINT ["migrate.sh"]
   CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
   ```

3. **Health Check Integration**
   - Added database health check endpoint
   - Included migration status in health checks
   - Improved error handling and logging

### Results
- Migrations run automatically during container startup
- Health checks accurately reflect migration status
- System startup is more reliable and automated

### Best Practices Learned
1. Keep migration scripts separate from application code
2. Use proper error handling in migration scripts
3. Implement proper health checks for database status
4. Follow standard Docker practices for entrypoints
5. Maintain clear logging for debugging migration issues

### Additional Considerations
1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Implement database backups before migrations
   - Store migration history
   - Plan rollback procedures

2. **Monitoring**
   - Log migration execution and results
   - Monitor migration duration
   - Alert on migration failures

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Keep migrations versioned in source control
   - Test migrations in development environment
   - Document migration changes
