## Health Check Configuration Issues and Solutions

### Initial Problem
The backend container was running but not passing its health check, which prevented the frontend and websocket services from starting.

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Health Check Configuration**
   - Found long intervals (30s) and start periods (30s) in health checks
   - Health check was only checking a single endpoint

2. **Health Check Optimization**
   - Reduced interval to 10 seconds
   - Reduced timeout to 5 seconds
   - Set start period to 15 seconds
   - Set retries to 3
   - Added checks for both `/health` and `/health/db` endpoints

3. **Circular Import Issue**
   - Discovered circular dependency between `__init__.py` and `app.py`
   - Health endpoints were not being registered correctly due to this issue

### Solution Implementation
1. **Docker Compose Health Check Updates**
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/health && curl -f http://localhost:5000/health/db"]
     interval: 10s
     timeout: 5s
     retries: 3
     start_period: 15s
   ```

2. **Code Restructuring**
   - Moved health endpoints from `app.py` to `__init__.py`
   - Separated concerns to avoid circular imports
   - Added proper logging for health check status

3. **Health Endpoints Implementation**
   ```python
   @app.route('/health')
   def health_check():
       return jsonify({'status': 'healthy'}), 200

   @app.route('/health/db')
   def db_health_check():
       try:
           db.session.execute('SELECT 1')
           return jsonify({'status': 'healthy'}), 200
       except Exception as e:
           return jsonify({'status': 'unhealthy'}), 500
   ```

### Results
- Backend health checks now pass consistently
- Frontend and websocket services start properly
- System startup is more reliable and faster

### Best Practices Learned
1. Keep health check intervals short but reasonable (10s)
2. Include multiple health check points (app, database)
3. Avoid circular imports in Flask applications
4. Properly structure initialization code
5. Use appropriate start periods for services that need warm-up time
