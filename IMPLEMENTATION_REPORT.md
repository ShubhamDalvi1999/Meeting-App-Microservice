# Implementation Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Stabilization

- ✅ Updated `docker-compose.yml` with improved health checks and startup sequence
- ✅ Enhanced `auth-service` Dockerfile with dependency checks and debugging info
- ✅ Verified `backend/flask-service/Dockerfile.fixed` properly addresses the OS module issue
- ✅ Added appropriate container dependencies to ensure proper startup order

### 2. Service Management Scripts

- ✅ Created `start.ps1` and `start.sh` scripts to enforce proper service startup sequence
- ✅ Created `migrate.ps1` and `migrate.sh` scripts to manage database migrations
- ✅ Made scripts compatible with both Windows and Unix-like systems

### 3. Documentation

- ✅ Created comprehensive `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` guide
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with clear setup and usage instructions
- ✅ Added detailed instructions for both Windows and Unix-like systems

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Database Migration Implementation

- [ ] Implement migration code in backend service
- [ ] Test migration scripts with actual databases
- [ ] Create sample data seeder scripts for development

### 2. Auth Service Enhancements

- [ ] Enhance JWT token handling and validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Update session management and cleanup tasks
- [ ] Improve integration with the backend service

### 3. Backend Service Optimization

- [ ] Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Enhance error handling with structured logging
- [ ] Optimize database queries

### 4. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Create automated tests for critical components
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing
- [ ] Create test-docker-compose.yml for isolated testing

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Configure Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards for service monitoring
- [ ] Create maintenance scripts for backup and recovery

## Conclusion

The initial stabilization and infrastructure improvements have been completed. The core services have been enhanced for better reliability and maintainability. The updated documentation provides clear instructions for setup and troubleshooting.

The next phase of work should focus on the specific service enhancements outlined in the next steps section, particularly around authentication, performance optimization, and testing.
